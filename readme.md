Weekend Challenge 1
For your weekend challenge, you will need to create an application that records employees along with their salary. We also want to add the salaries up so we know how much weâ€™re spending each month.

The application should first have an input form that collects the following:

Employee First Name

Employee Last Name

ID Number

Job Title

Annual Salary

A 'Submit' button should clear out the inputs and your logic should store that information. Then, that information should be appended to the DOM so the user of the application can see the information they just entered.

Finally, your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report back the Monthly cost of salaries.
